Roadmap

1. Adding and removing ensembles to assemby
 - changing ensembles argument from List to Map
2. Create Input Transfomer Class
 - as a subclass: Mask, which can mask out some of the input
3. Create decaying aggregate reward models to increase opennes to data drift
4. Create a Reward Scaler, so that Rewards can be rescaled to [0.0, 1.0] with some lag
5. Create a new custom data structure to pass around ModelIDs
 -> this structure needs to enable Assembly becoming a subclass of Model, to enable assembly stacking
6. Complete setters for all Classes, so that Ensembles can be reconstructed from exported Jsons
7. Figure out backup systems so that at crash a system can be reinitialised
